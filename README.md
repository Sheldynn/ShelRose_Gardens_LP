/** A landing page for a Rose Garden (Farm) business concept **/

This is an assignment from The Odin Project community designed to employ my knowledge 
of CSS concepts, with an emphasis on FlexBox tools. The design is provided for me, and I 
must attempt to recreate it as closely as possible, while maintaining customization discretion,
hence choosing the business concept I've had for a while. This will make it fun and interesting for me
as I work on this project.
